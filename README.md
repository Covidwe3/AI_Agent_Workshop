# ACM San Francisco Bay Area AI Agent Workshop Setup Guide  

Follow these steps to set up your environment:  

## 1. Fork the Repository  
Click the fork button on GitHub to create your own copy of the repository.  

## 2. Open the Forked Repository in GitHub Codespaces  
Modify the URL by replacing `github.com` with `github.dev`.  

## 3. Sign in to GitHub  
Choose your GitHub account to proceed.  

## 4. Select a Deployment  
A minimal resource allocation (e.g., 2 cores) is sufficient.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** You may stop the server once you complete the task to avoid unnecessary charges, even if the server is idle.  Open codespaces [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), select `...` for the code space and select `Stop`.

## 5. Wait for VS Code to Launch  
The environment will open in Visual Studio Code and start installing Python automatically.  

## 6. Open the Terminal  
Access the terminal from the VS Code interface.  

## 7. Run the Required Commands  
Follow the provided instructions in the repository to set up your environment.  

## 8. (Optional) Make the Server Public  
If needed, you can expose the port to the public, allowing others to access your server.  


# Setup environment
```bash
./setup.sh
activate venv/bin/activate
```

# Run Server
```bash
./run.sh
```
